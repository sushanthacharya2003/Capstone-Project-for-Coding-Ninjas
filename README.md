- CSS styling that ensures responsiveness across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).  
- Organized assets (images, stylesheets) in dedicated folders for maintainability.

🔭 Possible Enhancements

Convert it to a single-page application (SPA) using a framework like React.

Add a dark mode toggle or print-optimized stylesheet for additional polish.
